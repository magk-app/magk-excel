# MCP Resources Error Fix

## Issue Description

The app was showing errors like:
```
Error occurred in handler for 'mcp:list-resources': McpError: MCP error -32601: Method not found
```

## Root Cause

Not all MCP servers implement the `listResources()` method. Some servers are **tools-only** and only provide tools, not resources:

- **Tools**: Functions the AI can call (like `fetch`, `write_excel`, `navigate`)
- **Resources**: Data sources the AI can read (like files, databases, APIs)

Many MCP servers (like `fetch`, `excel`, `puppeteer`) only provide tools and don't have resources.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Made resource loading optional** - If a server doesn't support resources, we now:
   - Log a friendly message: `ðŸ“‹ Server {name} does not support resources (tools-only server)`
   - Continue with an empty resources array
   - Don't throw errors

2. **Added error handling in IPC** - The main process now catches resource errors and returns empty arrays instead of crashing

3. **Graceful degradation** - Tools still work perfectly even if resources fail

## Result

âœ… **No more resource errors!**
âœ… **All MCP servers connect successfully**
âœ… **Tools work perfectly**
âœ… **Resources work for servers that support them**

The errors you saw were just harmless resource loading attempts that are now handled gracefully.
