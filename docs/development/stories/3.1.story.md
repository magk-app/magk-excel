## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Semi-Dynamic UI Generation):
- Context-aware UI generation system implemented with Amazon Bedrock integration
- Pre-built UI control library created with specialized workflow patterns
- PyQt template system established for dynamic UI creation
- UI generation API endpoint integrated with executable packaging pipeline
- Client-side UI preview functionality implemented for user approval
- All components tested and validated for seamless integration

### Data Models
**HKImmigrationConfig**: This story will work with a specialized configuration for HK immigration data:
- `websiteUrl`: Base URL for HK immigration statistics website
- `dateRange`: Start and end dates for visitor statistics extraction
- `dataCategories`: Specific categories of visitor data to extract (by country, entry point, etc.)
- `tableSelectors`: CSS/XPath selectors for target data tables on the website
- `outputFormat`: Excel formatting specifications for extracted statistics
- `schedulingOptions`: Optional automated extraction scheduling configuration

### API Specifications
This story will extend the existing workflow system with HK immigration-specific functionality:
- **Enhanced Endpoint**: `/execute-workflow` extended for HK immigration workflows
- **Purpose**: To handle specialized web scraping for HK government immigration data
- **Request Body**: HKImmigrationConfig object with date range and extraction parameters
- **Response**: `{ "outputUrl": "<S3 pre-signed URL>", "extractionSummary": "<summary_data>" }`
- Integration with Epic 1 web extraction and Epic 2 UI generation capabilities
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#POST /execute-workflow]

### Component Specifications
**HK Immigration Web Scraper**: Specialized web extraction module for Hong Kong government website

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Testing]

### Technical Constraints
**Government Website Requirements**:
- Must handle potential website changes, maintenance windows, and access restrictions
- Navigation must be respectful of government website rate limits and policies
- Data extraction must preserve data integrity and handle formatting variations
- Date range selection must align with available data periods on the website
- Excel output must maintain professional formatting suitable for business analysis
- Tool must handle potential website downtime gracefully with appropriate error messages
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Web Scraping Framework, architecture/deployment-strategy.md#External Dependencies]

### Security and Performance Considerations
**Government Website Security**: 
- Implement respectful scraping practices with appropriate delays between requests
- Handle potential authentication requirements and session management
- Validate extracted data for consistency and completeness before Excel generation
- Implement robust error handling for website structure changes
**Performance**: 
- Optimize extraction process for large date ranges without overwhelming the server
- Implement progress indicators for long-running extraction operations
- Cache common website structure information to reduce redundant requests
- Ensure Excel generation performance scales with extracted data volume

## Project Structure Notes

This story represents the first concrete implementation of the complete MAGK platform, combining Epic 1's extraction capabilities with Epic 2's conversational UI generation to create a real-world demonstration tool. The HK Immigration use case will serve as the primary proof-of-concept for senior management presentations, showcasing the platform's ability to automatically generate sophisticated data extraction tools from natural language conversations. The implementation will establish patterns and infrastructure that will be reused for the remaining Epic 3 use cases (Alibaba PDF and Excel Supermacro), creating a solid foundation for the platform's showcase capabilities.
