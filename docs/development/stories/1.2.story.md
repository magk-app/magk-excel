# Story 1.2: PDF Data Extraction Foundation

## Story Info

- **Epic:** 1 - Core Automation Engine  
- **Story Number:** 1.2  
- **Status:** Ready for Review  
- **Created:** 2025-07-29  

## Story Statement

**As a** developer, **I want** to create a Python module that can open a text-based PDF and extract a specified data table, **so that** MAGK can handle PDF-based data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The module accepts a file path or URL to a PDF and a table identifier.
2. The module correctly parses text-based tables.
3. The module correctly recognizes non-standard number formats (commas, accounting negatives, units).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (Web Data Extraction Foundation):
- Project structure is established with `apps/server/chalicelib/` for backend modules
- Chalice application is configured and working with AWS Lambda compatibility
- Error handling pattern established using try/except blocks with CloudWatch logging
- WebExtractor class provides a good architectural pattern to follow for PDF extraction
- Testing strategy uses pytest with comprehensive mocking for external dependencies

### Data Models
**WorkflowConfig**: This story will work with the WorkflowConfig data model which includes:
- `sourceType`: Will be 'pdf' for this module
- `sourceUri`: File path or URL to the PDF document containing the data table
- `dataIdentifier`: String to identify the specific table (e.g., table heading text or page number)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#WorkflowConfig]

### API Specifications
This module will be called from the `/execute-workflow` endpoint:
- **Purpose**: To trigger the data extraction workflow for PDF sources
- **Request Body**: The WorkflowConfig object in JSON format with sourceType='pdf'
- **Response**: `{ "outputUrl": "<https://s3>..." }` (A pre-signed URL to download the generated Excel file)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#WorkflowConfig]

### Component Specifications
**PDF Parsing Technology**: PyMuPDF 1.23.x will be used for PDF text extraction and table parsing
- **Rationale**: Excellent performance and accuracy for PDF processing
- **Location**: This module will be part of the serverless backend in the chalicelib directory
- **Integration**: Will follow the same pattern as WebExtractor from Story 1.1
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#PDF Parsing]

### File Locations
Based on the project structure and following the pattern from Story 1.1:
- **Backend Module**: `apps/server/chalicelib/pdf_extractor.py`
- **Main API Logic**: Integration in `apps/server/app.py` (extend existing execute-workflow endpoint)
- **Tests**: `apps/server/tests/test_pdf_extractor.py`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Project Structure]

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing**: 
- Automated unit tests using `pytest` will be implemented for the core PDF extraction module
- Tests will be located in the server tests directory alongside existing web extractor tests
- Primary focus on foundational reliability following established testing patterns
- Mock PDF files and test data will be created for comprehensive testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Testing]

### Technical Constraints
**Python Version**: Python 3.10.x is required for consistency with the backend
**AWS Platform**: Module will run on AWS Lambda functions with PyMuPDF compatibility
**Error Handling**: Use standard Python try/except blocks with CloudWatch logging following established pattern
**PDF Format Support**: Focus on text-based PDFs (not scanned/image PDFs)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Backend Language, architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Server-Side]

### Security and Performance Considerations
**File Handling**: Secure handling of PDF file uploads and processing
**Performance**: PDF processing can be memory-intensive, ensure Lambda memory limits are respected
**AWS Lambda Scaling**: Automatic scaling with consideration for PDF processing overhead
**Data Format Recognition**: Handle various number formats including commas, accounting negatives, and units
