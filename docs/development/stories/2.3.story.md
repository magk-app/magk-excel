# Story 2.3: Script to Executable Packaging

## Story Info

- **Epic:** 2 - Conversational Builder & Tool Generation  
- **Story Number:** 2.3  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Created:** 2025-07-30  

## Story Statement

**As a** Junior Analyst, **I want** the final output to be a single, clickable .exe file, **so that** I have a permanent, easy-to-use tool.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system packages the script and UI into a single .exe.
2. The user is prompted for a filename.
3. The .exe is saved to a specified location.
4. The tool is self-contained and shareable.
5. (Recommended) An AI-generated 'readme.txt' is created.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2 (Workflow to Script Generation):
- Script generation backend service implemented with Amazon Bedrock integration
- Script template system created for different workflow types (web, PDF, Excel)
- Generated scripts correctly call Epic 1 modules with proper error handling
- Temporary script storage and client-side script management functionality established
- Chat interface integration completed for script generation workflow

### Data Models
**ExecutableConfig**: This story will work with a new ExecutableConfig data model:
- `scriptContent`: Python script content generated from Story 2.2
- `executableName`: User-specified filename for the .exe file
- `outputPath`: Directory path where the .exe should be saved
- `includeReadme`: Boolean flag for AI-generated readme inclusion
- `uiComponents`: UI elements to be packaged with the script

### API Specifications
This story will extend the existing API with a new packaging endpoint:
- **New Endpoint**: `/package-executable`
- **Purpose**: To package generated scripts into standalone executable files
- **Request Body**: ExecutableConfig object with script content and packaging preferences
- **Response**: `{ "executableUrl": "<https://s3>...", "readmeContent": "<AI_generated_readme>" }`
- Integration with existing script generation workflow from Story 2.2
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#POST /package-executable]

### Component Specifications
**Executable Packaging Engine**: PyInstaller integration for Python to .exe conversion
- **Rationale**: Industry-standard tool for creating standalone Windows executables from Python scripts
- **Location**: Backend service in `apps/server/chalicelib/executable_packager.py`
- **Integration**: Works with generated scripts from Story 2.2 and Epic 1 modules

### File Locations
Based on the established project structure and previous story implementations:
- **Executable Packager Module**: `apps/server/chalicelib/executable_packager.py`
- **Packaging Templates**: `apps/server/chalicelib/templates/executable/`
- **Client Packaging Manager**: `apps/client/src/api/packaging_manager.py`
- **UI Template Files**: `apps/server/chalicelib/templates/ui/`
- **Tests**: `apps/server/tests/test_executable_packager.py`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Project Structure]

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing**: 
- Automated unit tests using `pytest` for packaging logic
- Mock PyInstaller operations for faster testing
- Validate generated executables can run independently
- Test various packaging configurations (with/without readme, different UI components)
- Integration tests with generated scripts from Story 2.2
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Testing]

### Technical Constraints
**Executable Packaging Requirements**:
- Generated .exe files must be self-contained with all dependencies
- Executables must be compatible with Windows 10/11 environments
- Package size should be optimized for easy sharing and distribution
- Executables must include Epic 1 modules and required Python libraries
- Support for custom icons and application metadata
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Executable Packaging, architecture/deployment-strategy.md#Desktop Distribution]

### Security and Performance Considerations
**Executable Security**: 
- Validate script content before packaging to prevent malicious code distribution
- Implement code signing for generated executables (if certificates available)
- Ensure executables don't expose source code or sensitive information
- Add basic antivirus scanning compatibility measures
**Performance**: 
- Optimize packaging process for reasonable build times
- Implement caching for common dependencies to speed up packaging
- Consider executable startup time optimization

## Project Structure Notes

This story extends the serverless backend architecture with executable packaging capabilities while maintaining consistency with the existing project organization. The packaging functionality will be added as a new module within the `apps/server/chalicelib/` directory, and client-side packaging management will be integrated into the existing desktop client structure. The story builds directly on the script generation capabilities from Story 2.2 and utilizes the core modules from Epic 1. No structural conflicts identified with the current project organization.
