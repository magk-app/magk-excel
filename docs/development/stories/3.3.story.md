## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system can process a folder of Excel files.
2. The tool appends data correctly to a master workbook.
3. The tool's UI includes input/output path specification.
4. The consolidated data is 100% accurate.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.2 (Use Case B - Alibaba PDF Report):
- Alibaba PDF financial extractor module implemented with specialized PDF parsing for annual reports

- `outputFilePath`: Target path for the consolidated master Excel workbook
- `filePattern`: Pattern for identifying relevant Excel files (e.g., "*_monthly_*.xlsx")
- `dataMapping`: Configuration for how data from source files should be mapped to master file
- `consolidationRules`: Rules for handling duplicate data, date ranges, and data validation
- `sheetConfiguration`: Specification for which sheets to process and how to organize in master file
- `dateExtraction`: Configuration for extracting date/period information from filenames or content

### Technical Constraints
**Excel Multi-File Processing Requirements**:
- Must handle varying Excel file structures and column arrangements across monthly files
- Data consolidation must preserve data integrity and handle conflicts intelligently
- Path selection must support both folder browsing and manual path entry
- Master workbook must maintain professional formatting and data organization
- Tool must handle large numbers of source files without performance degradation
- Date extraction from filenames must handle multiple naming conventions
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Excel Processing Framework, architecture/deployment-strategy.md#External Dependencies]

### Security and Performance Considerations
**Excel Data Security**: 
- Implement secure handling of potentially sensitive business data across multiple files
- Validate consolidated data for completeness and accuracy before master file generation
- Implement robust error handling for file access permissions and corruption scenarios
- Handle potential memory constraints when processing large numbers of Excel files
**Performance**: 
- Optimize Excel file reading process for batch processing of multiple files
- Implement progress indicators for multi-file consolidation operations
- Cache common Excel parsing patterns to reduce redundant processing
- Ensure consolidation performance scales with number of source files and data volume

## Project Structure Notes

This story represents the third concrete implementation of the complete MAGK platform, building on the web extraction capabilities from Story 3.1 and PDF processing capabilities from Story 3.2. The Excel Supermacro use case will showcase the platform's ability to handle complex multi-file Excel consolidation scenarios, demonstrating sophisticated data management capabilities that appeal to business analysts and financial professionals. The implementation will establish patterns for Excel-based data consolidation that can be extended to other multi-file scenarios, creating a robust foundation for the platform's data aggregation capabilities and completing the trio of core demo use cases for Epic 3.
