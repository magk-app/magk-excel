# Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing (Primary for MVP):** In line with the PRD, automated unit tests, created by AI agents using `pytest`, will be implemented for the core backend modules in `chalicelib`. This ensures foundational reliability.
- **Manual Testing:** The primary focus will be end-to-end manual testing of the three core demo use cases to ensure a flawless presentation.
