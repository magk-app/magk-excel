# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the MAGK Demo. It covers the backend logic, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This architecture is based on the approved PRD and the UI/UX Specification.

**Architectural Pivot:** Based on a review of the project's timeline and computational requirements, the architecture has been updated from a local-only model to a client-server model. This change addresses feasibility concerns while maintaining the core user experience and security principles.
