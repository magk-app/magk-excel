## 1.3 Acceptance Criteria

1. The module can create a new Excel workbook.
2. The module can write a list of lists to a sheet. **In particular, the tables extracted from 1.1 and 1.2, from HTML-tables and PDFs, respectively**
3. The module can save in both .xlsx and .xls formats. 
4. (Nice to have) The module can update an Excel file in real-time.

## 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

1. A small AI model analyzes the workflow context.
2. Based on the context, it selects appropriate pre-built UI controls. **For example, a tool designed on extracting Alibaba's annual report data could be extended to other companies with a 'select annual report' feature, or a tool getting daily data from HK border crossing could have a date range selector.**
3. The selected controls are included in the final packaged UI.

## 3.5 Acceptance Criteria

1. Programs are able to standardize differing report data formats when the user desires this functionality.
2. **Ensure that** The same metrics (e.g., total assets, net cash from investing, operating profit) are consistently accessible and in the same place across different company reports **when we export them to Excel documents.**
3. The system can map varying terminology (e.g., "Operating profit" vs "EBIT", "Cost of goods sold" vs "Cost of sales") to standardized field names. **Additionally, it can recognize that for some companies, data may not be disclosed at all. eg. some companies may not have 'inventories'.**
4. Users can configure and customize standardization mappings for their specific analysis needs.

## Development Setup Requirements

### Chrome and ChromeDriver Setup

**✅ COMPLETED**: Developer setup documentation has been updated to include:

1. **Chrome Browser Installation**: Local developers must install Google Chrome browser for web scraping functionality.
2. **ChromeDriver Installation**: Install ChromeDriver that matches the developer's operating system and Chrome browser version for automated browser control.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variable paths in the `.env` file to point to Chrome and ChromeDriver installations.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Updated the getting-started guide and setup documentation to reflect these new requirements.

**Impact**: This setup is required for development and testing of web extraction features that rely on browser automation.

**Changes Made**:
- Merged Windows setup guide into main getting-started.md
- Added comprehensive Chrome/ChromeDriver installation instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Added environment configuration examples
- Added verification and troubleshooting sections
- Updated automated setup scripts to include Chrome/ChromeDriver validation

## PO Master Validation Results - July 31, 2025

### Executive Summary

**Project Status**: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (68% readiness)
**Recommendation**: Fix 12 critical items before development proceeds
**Project Type**: Greenfield with UI Components (PyQt + AWS Serverless)

### Critical Blocking Issues Identified

#### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blockers)

**1. AWS Infrastructure Setup Missing**
- **Problem**: No AWS account setup, Bedrock access, or credential management defined in stories
- **Impact**: Development will halt when hitting external service dependencies
- **Stories Affected**: 1.1, 2.2, 2.4
- **Action Required**: Add AWS setup tasks to Story 1.1, define user responsibilities for account creation

**2. Data Schema Foundation Missing**
- **Problem**: No schema definitions for WorkflowConfig, table structures, Excel data, UI configurations
- **Impact**: Data validation failures, integration issues between modules
- **Stories Affected**: 1.1-1.3, 2.1
- **Action Required**: Create new Story 1.0 for Data Architecture Foundation, implement SQLite for demo

**3. UI Framework Foundation Weak**
- **Problem**: PyQt setup occurs too late (Story 2.1), no design system or styling approach defined
- **Impact**: UI development will be inconsistent and error-prone
- **Stories Affected**: 2.1, 2.4
- **Action Required**: Move PyQt setup to Story 1.1, establish component library and accessibility requirements

#### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality Issues)

**4. External Service Authentication**: Bedrock API access not properly sequenced
**5. Error Handling Patterns**: Inconsistent across stories
**6. Performance Monitoring**: No measurement or feedback collection planned

### Section-by-Section Analysis Results

| Section | Pass Rate | Status | Critical Issues |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | 93% | ✅ GOOD | 1 |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | 69% | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 2 |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | 22% | ❌ POOR | 4 |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | 33% | ❌ POOR | 5 |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | 75% | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 1 |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | 92% | ✅ GOOD | 0 |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | 78% | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 1 |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | 50% | ❌ POOR | 3 |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | 25% | ❌ POOR | 4 |

### Proposed Story Modifications

**New Story 1.0: Data Architecture Foundation**
```
As a developer, I want to establish data schemas and storage patterns,
so that the system has consistent data validation.

Tasks:
- Define WorkflowConfig, TableData, ExcelData, UIConfig schemas
- Set up SQLite for local demo storage  
- Create schema validation utilities
- Implement simple JWT authentication
- Document AWS migration path
```

**Modified Story 1.1: Add Infrastructure Setup**
```
Task 0 additions:
- 0.11. Set up AWS account and service access requirements
- 0.12. Configure Amazon Bedrock service access and API keys
- 0.13. Create credential management and storage strategy
- 0.14. Set up PyQt 6.x framework and component library
- 0.15. Define UI styling and theming approach
```

### Timeline Impact

- **New Story 1.0**: +2-3 days
- **Story modifications**: +1-2 days per story
- **AWS setup dependencies**: Requires user action (account creation)
- **Total estimated delay**: 5-7 days

### Next Steps for PM

1. **Review scope** - Confirm Story 3.6 (Excel add-in) necessity for August demo
2. **Assign AWS setup** - Determine who creates accounts/configures services  
3. **Approve schema approach** - SQLite for demo vs immediate AWS integration
4. **Schedule story updates** - Plan integration of new tasks into existing stories
5. **Developer briefing** - Ensure team understands new foundational requirements

### Validation Methodology

This analysis was conducted using the BMad PO Master Validation Checklist, evaluating 10 categories of project readiness against greenfield project best practices. The checklist identified gaps in infrastructure setup, external dependencies, UI/UX foundations, and post-MVP planning that could impact development velocity and deliverable quality.

**Key Takeaway**: Strong technical architecture and feature sequencing, but missing essential setup and infrastructure pieces that would cause development delays if not addressed upfront.
