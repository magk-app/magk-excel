# Constraints & Assumptions
**Constraints**
* **Timeline:** There is a non-negotiable one-week deadline to produce a working demo for the presentation on August 5th (China Time).
* **Resources:** The development team consists of two members.
* **Technical:** The solution must be a local Windows desktop application and must maintain compatibility with older, enterprise-standard versions of Microsoft Excel (including `.xls` format).

**Key Assumptions**
* **Technical Feasibility:** We assume that the "semi-dynamic" UI and real-time Excel updates are technically feasible to implement as a proof-of-concept within the one-week timeframe.
* **Novel Workflow Capability:** We assume the workflow generation engine will be robust enough to handle a *novel*, simple workflow request live during the demo, beyond the pre-planned primary use cases. The system will not be hardcoded only for the specific examples.
* **User Permissions:** We assume that the Junior Analysts will have the necessary permissions on their corporate machines to run the standalone executable tools generated by MAGK.
* **Source Stability:** We assume that the website layouts and PDF report structures for any potential demo use cases will not change during the development week.
* **Environment Stability:** We assume a stable and controlled technical environment will be available for the live presentation.
