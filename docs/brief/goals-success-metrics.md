* **For the Junior Analyst (User):** Achieve 100% data accuracy for the demonstrated workflow, completely eliminating manual copy-paste errors.
* **For the Senior Analyst (Beneficiary):** Enable a novel data workflow to be automated within a single conversational session, operated by a junior analyst.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Demo**
* **Demo Success Rate:** 100% successful, error-free execution of the primary demo use case during the live presentation.
