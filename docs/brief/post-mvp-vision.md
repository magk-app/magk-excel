# Post-MVP Vision
**Phase 2 Features (Immediate Next Steps)**
* **Fully Dynamic Customizability Engine:** Transition from the demo's "smart template" to a fully dynamic engine where the AI intelligently identifies all variables in a user's request and generates a complex, customized UI for the tool automatically.
* **Conversational Program Modification:** Allow users to refine and edit already-created tools through follow-up conversation (e.g., "Take the Alibaba tool you made and add a column for 'Gross Margin'").
* **Generative Web Search:** Enable MAGK to find reports and data sources without a direct URL (e.g., "Find the latest annual report for Alibaba and extract the financials").
* **Source Reference-ability:** A key feature to allow analysts to instantly trace any piece of data in an Excel sheet back to its original source document (PDF page or website table).

**Long-term Vision**
* **Screen Capture to Workflow:** Evolve the input method from natural language chat to allowing an analyst to simply record their screen performing a task, with MAGK observing and automatically creating the automation tool.
* **Internal Knowledge Base:** Develop MAGK into a true "AI Intern" that retains a memory of previously gathered data, learns analyst preferences, and can proactively provide information.
* **Microsoft Office Suite Integration:** Expand beyond Excel to provide seamless, context-aware automation for Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

**Expansion Opportunities**
* **Beyond Equity Research:** Adapt the MAGK platform to serve other departments within the firm (e.g., compliance, operations, sales) that face similar manual data workflow challenges.
