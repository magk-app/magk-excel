# Problem Statement
* **Current State & Pain Points:** Equity researchers at firms like China Galaxy Securities International spend a significant portion of their day on low-value, manual tasks. This includes navigating various websites to find specific financial reports, manually downloading PDFs and Excel files, and meticulously copy-pasting data into their own spreadsheets. This process is not only time-consuming but also highly prone to human error (e.g., numbers in text-based PDFs being copied incorrectly as '6, 157' instead of '6157').
* **Impact of the Problem:** The high volume of manual work directly reduces the time available for core, high-value activities such as analysis, modeling, and generating insights. The risk of data errors compromises the integrity of research and can lead to flawed conclusions, creating significant reputational and financial risk.
* **Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Existing solutions like Perplexity or ChatGPT fall short because successfully "vibe coding" a complex workflow requires a significant level of technical intuition, akin to intermediate programming knowledge. Senior analysts, the target users, do not possess this specialized prompt engineering skill. Furthermore, these tools generate one-off solutions, not the permanent, reusable, and simple one-click programs needed for recurring tasks. They also lack the deep, contextual integration with Excel (e.g., acting on highlighted cells, automating cross-file tasks) that is essential for financial workflows.
* **Urgency & Importance:** With a presentation to senior management scheduled for August 5th (China Time), there is a brief, high-stakes window to demonstrate a forward-thinking AI solution. Effectively showcasing a tool that solves these long-standing inefficiencies can secure buy-in and position the firm as an innovator in applying AI to its core business.
