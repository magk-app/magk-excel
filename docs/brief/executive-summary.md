# Executive Summary
This project's objective is to develop a high-impact, proof-of-concept demo of "MAGK," an AI tool designed to provide financial analysts with easy access to create their own ad-hoc automation tools. MAGK addresses the core problem that senior equity researchers spend excessive time on manual, repetitive data extraction and processing from websites, PDFs, and Excel. Targeting experienced, non-technical analysts, MAGK's key value proposition is its ability to transform complex, multi-step workflows into simple, one-click, reusable programs through simple, natural language conversation, saving significant time and reducing errors. Unlike general-purpose AIs, MAGK creates permanent, customizable automation tools accessible to users with zero programming knowledge.
