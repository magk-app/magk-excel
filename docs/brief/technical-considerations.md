# Technical Considerations
**Platform Requirements**
* **Target Platforms:** This will be a desktop application for Windows, as it needs to interact deeply with locally installed software like Microsoft Excel and the local file system.
* **Performance Requirements:** The application must remain responsive during workflow execution, especially during the "real-time" Excel updates, to provide a seamless user experience.

**Technology Preferences**
* **Primary Language:** Python seems to be the preferred language, given its strong ecosystem of libraries for data extraction (e.g., Selenium, BeautifulSoup), PDF parsing (e.g., PyMuPDF), and Excel manipulation (e.g., openpyxl).
* **User Interface:** A desktop GUI framework will be needed for the "seamless window." Python-native options like Tkinter or PyQt are possibilities.
* **Excel Compatibility:** The method used to interact with Excel must be compatible with **Excel 2007 specifications (.xls format)** in addition to modern formats.
* **Packaging:** The final generated tool will be packaged as a standalone Windows Executable (`.exe`).

**Architecture Considerations**
* **Service Architecture:** A local, self-contained application architecture is most appropriate for the MVP, rather than a client-server or web-based model.
* **Integration Requirements:** The most critical integration is with the local operating system to read files and with the Microsoft Excel application itself, **ensuring backward compatibility with older, enterprise-standard versions.**
* **Security/Compliance:** As the tool will handle potentially sensitive financial data from reports, all processing must occur locally on the user's machine, and no data should be transmitted externally.
