# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the MAGK Demo's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience that feels "magical" and effortless.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

- **Primary User (Operator): The Junior Analyst / Intern** - A tech-savvy but non-programming employee who is delegated manual data gathering tasks and needs a simple, reliable way to automate them.
- **Secondary User (Beneficiary): The Senior Equity Research Analyst** - The key stakeholder who identifies workflows for automation and benefits from the increased speed and data integrity of their team's output.

### Usability Goals

- **Effortless Automation:** A user must be able to turn a complex, multi-step workflow into a simple, one-click program through a single, natural language conversation.
- **Time Reduction:** Reduce the time to complete a complex data extraction task by over 90% compared to the manual process.
- **Flawless Accuracy:** Achieve 100% data accuracy for all demonstrated workflows.

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity by Default:** The interface should be clean and intuitive, hiding all technical complexity.
2. **Conversational Flow:** The primary interaction should feel like a natural conversation with a helpful intern.
3. **Immediate & Transparent Feedback:** The user should always see the result of their actions.
4. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Prioritize clear communication and straightforward interactions.
5. **Target Audience:** The interface should be professional and futuristic, to draw the eyes of senior management at a bank like CGS.
