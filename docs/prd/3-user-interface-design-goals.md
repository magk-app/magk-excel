# 3. User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**: The user experience should feel "magical" and effortless. The user should be able to go from a complex idea to a working tool through a simple, intuitive conversation, with the AI handling all complexity. The real-time updates to the user's open Excel file are key to this experience.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**: The primary interaction will be a standard chat interface. The secondary interaction will be with the generated tool's simple UI, which will use standard controls like date pickers or text inputs.

**Core Screens and Views**:

- Main Chat Window: A clean, simple interface for conversing with MAGK.
- Generated Tool UI: A small, modal window for the executable program, featuring the dynamically selected input controls (e.g., date range) and a "Run" button.

**Accessibility**: Not a primary focus for the MVP demo, but standard Windows UI controls should be used to ensure basic usability.

**Branding**: No specific branding is required for the demo. The focus is on functionality and a clean, professional appearance.

**Target Device and Platforms**: Windows Desktop.
