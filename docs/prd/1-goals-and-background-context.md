# 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals**

- **Business Goal:** To successfully demonstrate MAGK's core value proposition in the August 5th presentation, securing a "go" decision from senior management for continued investment.
- **User Goal (Junior Analyst):** To achieve 100% data accuracy on complex, multi-source data extraction tasks, completely eliminating manual errors while still significantly reducing the time required compared to the manual process.
- **Stakeholder Goal (Senior Analyst):** To enable a novel data workflow to be automated within a single conversational session, operated by a junior analyst, thus increasing team efficiency and data integrity.

**Background Context**
Equity researchers at firms like China Galaxy Securities International currently expend significant time on manual, error-prone data extraction from websites, PDFs, and Excel. This manual process limits the time available for high-value analysis and introduces the risk of flawed conclusions due to data entry errors. MAGK addresses this by providing a simple chat interface, deeply integrated with Microsoft Excel, that allows non-technical analysts to describe a repetitive workflow in natural language. MAGK then generates a permanent, reusable, one-click program to execute that task. Unlike general-purpose AI tools that produce one-off code snippets, MAGK creates lasting automation solutions, empowering analysts to build their own ad-hoc tools without any programming knowledge. This demo serves as a proof-of-concept to showcase this transformative potential.
