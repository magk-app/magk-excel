   - Command injection
   - Path traversal
   - JSON injection

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Session management
   - Privilege escalation
   - Access control bypass

3. **Secrets & Cryptography**
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Weak cryptographic implementations
   - Insecure key storage

4. **Code Execution**
   - Remote code execution
   - Unsafe deserialization
   - Eval injection

5. **Data Exposure**
   - Sensitive data logging
   - PII handling
   - Information disclosure

## Methodology

### Analysis Process

1. **Static Code Analysis**: Line-by-line review of all new and modified code
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Traced user inputs through the application to identify injection points
3. **Dependency Review**: Examined new npm packages for known vulnerabilities
4. **Configuration Review**: Analyzed configuration files for security misconfigurations
5. **False Positive Filtering**: Applied confidence scoring (threshold ≥8/10) to eliminate noise

### Tools & Techniques

- Manual code review with security focus
- TypeScript type analysis
- React security best practices validation
- OWASP Top 10 checklist verification

## Detailed Findings

### High-Priority Findings

**None identified.** All code changes follow secure coding practices.

### Medium-Priority Findings

**None identified.** No issues meeting the medium severity threshold.

### Low-Priority Observations (Not Security Vulnerabilities)

#### 1. Console Logging in Development Code
- **Location**: Multiple service files
- **Risk**: Minimal - Development only
- **Recommendation**: Use environment-based conditional logging for production

#### 2. Mock Service Dynamic Method Calls
- **Location**: `mockExcelServer.js:28-29`
- **Risk**: None - Mock service with limited method surface
- **Status**: False positive - Acceptable for development mock

#### 3. Drag-and-Drop JSON Parsing
- **Location**: `WorkflowEditor.tsx:196-200`
- **Risk**: None - Internal application data flow
- **Status**: False positive - React's XSS protections apply

## Security Strengths

### Positive Security Practices Observed

✅ **Strong Type Safety**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and type checking
- Proper type assertions preventing type confusion attacks

✅ **Modern State Management**
- Zustand with Immer for immutable state updates
- No direct DOM manipulation vulnerabilities

✅ **React Security Best Practices**
- No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Proper event handler sanitization
- Synthetic event handling

✅ **Secure Configuration**
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Environment variables properly referenced
- Mock services for development isolation

✅ **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Proper error boundaries
- No sensitive information in error messages

## Recommendations

While no security vulnerabilities were found, the following recommendations will enhance security posture:

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   ```javascript
   // Add to Electron main process
   session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => {
     callback({
       responseHeaders: {
         ...details.responseHeaders,
         'Content-Security-Policy': ["default-src 'self'"]
       }
     })
   })
   ```

2. **Add Input Validation Layer**
   - Implement zod or joi schema validation for workflow configurations
   - Validate all external data before processing

3. **Enable Production Security Headers**
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Strict-Transport-Security (for web deployment)

4. **Remove Development Artifacts**
   - Conditional compilation of console.log statements
   - Remove mock services from production builds
   - Minimize exposed debug information

### Long-term Security Enhancements

1. **Implement Rate Limiting** when connecting to real backend services
2. **Add Audit Logging** for security-relevant operations
3. **Regular Dependency Updates** using automated tools like Dependabot
4. **Security Testing Integration** in CI/CD pipeline

## Compliance & Standards
