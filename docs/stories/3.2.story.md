### Technical Constraints
**PDF Financial Report Requirements**:
- Must handle complex multi-column financial statement layouts in PDF format
- Data extraction must preserve financial number formatting and accounting conventions
- Year selection must align with available annual report periods
- Excel output must maintain professional financial statement formatting standards
- Tool must handle PDF structural variations across different report years
- Financial data must be validated for mathematical consistency (balance sheet balance, etc.)

### Security and Performance Considerations
**Financial Data Security**: 
- Implement secure handling of potentially sensitive financial information
- Validate extracted financial data for completeness and accuracy before Excel generation
- Implement robust error handling for PDF structure variations across report years
- Handle potential OCR requirements for image-based PDF sections gracefully
**Performance**: 
- Optimize PDF parsing process for large annual report documents
- Implement progress indicators for multi-table extraction operations
- Cache common PDF parsing patterns to reduce redundant processing
- Ensure Excel generation performance scales with extracted financial data volume
