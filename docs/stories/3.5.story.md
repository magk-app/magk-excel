# Story 3.5: Data Standardisation Framework

## Story Info

- **Epic:** 3 - Demo Showcase & Live Integration  
- **Story Number:** 3.5  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Created:** 2025-07-30  

## Story Statement

**As an** analyst, **I want** my generalized tool to get data from different companies' annual reports to have options to standardize the Excel output, **so that** I can easily compare data across companies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Programs are able to standardize differing report data formats when the user desires this functionality.
2. The same metrics (e.g., total assets, net cash from investing, operating profit) are consistently accessible and in the same place across different company reports.
3. The system can map varying terminology (e.g., "Operating profit" vs "EBIT", "Cost of goods sold" vs "Cost of sales") to standardized field names.
4. Users can configure and customize standardization mappings for their specific analysis needs.

### Technical Constraints
**Data Standardization Requirements**:
- Must handle varying financial statement formats across different accounting standards (GAAP, IFRS)
- Fuzzy matching algorithms required for intelligent field recognition and mapping
- User configuration interface must be intuitive for non-technical analysts
- Standardization process must preserve original data integrity while creating normalized output
- System must handle edge cases where standardization mappings are ambiguous or incomplete
- Performance must scale for processing multiple company reports in batch operations

### Security and Performance Considerations
**Data Standardization Security**: 
- Implement secure handling of sensitive financial data during standardization processing
- Validate user-defined mapping rules to prevent injection attacks or data corruption
- Ensure standardized output maintains data lineage and traceability to original sources
- Handle confidential company information with appropriate access controls and audit trails
**Performance**: 
- Optimize field recognition algorithms for real-time processing during data extraction
- Implement intelligent caching for frequently used standardization mappings and schemas
- Ensure standardization processing doesn't significantly impact overall workflow execution time
- Support batch standardization operations for processing multiple reports efficiently

## Project Structure Notes

This story establishes the critical data standardization framework that transforms MAGK from a simple extraction tool into a sophisticated financial analysis platform. By enabling consistent data formatting across different companies and reports, analysts can perform meaningful cross-company comparisons and build reliable analytical workflows. The standardization capabilities will significantly enhance the value proposition demonstrated in the August 5th presentation, showing senior management that MAGK can handle the complexity and variability inherent in real-world financial data analysis. This framework creates the foundation for advanced analytical capabilities and positions MAGK as an enterprise-grade solution for financial research teams.
