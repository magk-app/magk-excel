# Story 2.4: Semi-Dynamic UI Generation

## Story Info

- **Epic:** 2 - Conversational Builder & Tool Generation  
- **Story Number:** 2.4  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Created:** 2025-07-30  

## Story Statement

**As a** developer, **I want** the generated executable to have a simple UI with context-aware controls, **so that** the tool is customizable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A small AI model analyzes the workflow context.
2. Based on the context, it selects appropriate pre-built UI controls.
3. The selected controls are included in the final packaged UI.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 (Script to Executable Packaging):
- Executable packaging system implemented with PyInstaller integration
- Generated .exe files are self-contained with all dependencies bundled
- Packaging templates created for different workflow types (web, PDF, Excel)
- UI component packaging infrastructure established with template system
- Executable validation and quality assurance processes implemented

### Data Models
**UIConfig**: This story will work with a new UIConfig data model:
- `workflowType`: Type of workflow ('web', 'pdf', 'excel') determining base UI template
- `contextParameters`: Extracted parameters from workflow description requiring user input
- `selectedControls`: AI-determined list of UI controls to include in the interface
- `controlProperties`: Configuration properties for each selected control (labels, validation, defaults)
- `layoutConfiguration`: Arrangement and styling information for the generated UI
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#UIConfig]

### API Specifications
This story will extend the existing packaging pipeline with UI generation capabilities:
- **New Endpoint**: `/generate-ui-config`
- **Purpose**: To analyze workflow context and determine appropriate UI controls
- **Request Body**: WorkflowConfig object with natural language workflow description
- **Response**: `{ "uiConfig": UIConfig, "generatedTemplate": "<ui_template_code>" }`
- Integration with existing executable packaging from Story 2.3
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#POST /generate-ui-config]

### Component Specifications
**Context-Aware UI Generator**: Amazon Bedrock integration for intelligent UI control selection
- **Rationale**: Leverages AI capabilities to analyze workflow requirements and select appropriate controls
- **Location**: Backend service in `apps/server/chalicelib/ui_generator.py`
- **Integration**: Works with packaging system from Story 2.3 and Epic 1 workflow modules

### File Locations
Based on the established project structure and previous story implementations:
- **UI Generator Module**: `apps/server/chalicelib/ui_generator.py`
- **UI Control Templates**: `apps/server/chalicelib/templates/ui_controls/`
- **PyQt Template System**: `apps/server/chalicelib/templates/pyqt/`
- **Client UI Preview Manager**: `apps/client/src/ui/ui_preview.py`
- **Tests**: `apps/server/tests/test_ui_generator.py`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Project Structure]

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing**: 
- Automated unit tests using `pytest` for UI generation logic
- Mock Bedrock responses for consistent testing of AI control selection
- Validate generated UI templates integrate correctly with packaging system
- Test various workflow types produce appropriate control selections
- Integration tests with Story 2.3 packaging and Epic 1 modules
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Testing]

### Technical Constraints
**UI Generation Requirements**:
- Generated UI must be compatible with PyQt 6.x framework
- UI controls must integrate seamlessly with packaged executables from Story 2.3
- Control selection must be deterministic for similar workflow types
- Generated interfaces must be responsive and user-friendly
- UI templates must support customization without breaking functionality
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#GUI Framework, architecture/deployment-strategy.md#Desktop Distribution]

### Security and Performance Considerations
**UI Generation Security**: 
- Validate AI-generated UI code for malicious content injection
- Sanitize user input parameters before UI template generation
- Ensure generated UI controls don't expose sensitive system access
- Implement input validation for all dynamically generated controls
**Performance**: 
- Optimize UI generation process for reasonable response times
- Implement caching for common UI control combinations
- Ensure generated UI performance doesn't impact executable startup time

## Project Structure Notes

This story extends the serverless backend architecture with intelligent UI generation capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with the executable packaging system from Story 2.3. The UI generation functionality will be added as a new module within the `apps/server/chalicelib/` directory, and client-side UI preview capabilities will be integrated into the existing desktop client structure. The story leverages the script generation from Story 2.2 and the packaging infrastructure from Story 2.3, creating a complete pipeline from conversation to customized executable tool. No structural conflicts identified with the current project organization.
