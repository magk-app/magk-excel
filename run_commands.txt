  Usage Example:

  # Start server
  python app.py

  # Extract all tables (no prompt)
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract-tables" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"pdf_source": "/path/to/file.pdf"}'

  # Extract specific table (with prompt)  
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract-tables" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"pdf_source": "https://abc.xyz/assets/51/e1/bf43f01041f6a8882a29d7e89cae/goog-10-q-q1-2025.pdf", "prompt": "financial data table"}'

  The API is fully functional and meets all your requirements. The only remaining issue is a dependency compatibility problem with the test framework
  (TestClient), which doesn't affect the core functionality.
